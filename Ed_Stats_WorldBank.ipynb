Try to think of projects that users or businesses will care about that are also relatively unanalyzed. Here are some useful links about data sources on our blog as well as the archive of data sources on Data is Plural. You can see some final projects of previous Fellows on our YouTube Page.\n",

Explain your motivation for tackling this problem, discuss the data source(s) you are using, and explain the analysis you are performing. At a minimum, you will need to do enough exploratory data analysis to convince someone that the project is viable and generate two interesting non-trivial plots or other assets supporting this. Explain the plots and give url links to them. For guidance on how to choose a project, check out this blog post."
