# The future of women in the global workforce

Global labor force participation rate has steadily declined since 1990 due to aging of population.  One of the approaches to reverse this trend is increasing female labor participation since it generally increases with economic development and sustainable development (International Labour Orgagnization).  
However, this relationship is neither straightforward nor consistent across countries (Verick, 2014).  This is due to differences in economic and social factors including economic growth, educational attainment, fertility rates and social norms.  
Study of female labor force participation as a driver of growth is essential as it may be crucial to alleviating the adverse economic effects of aging demographics.

I believe this is an opportune time to study women’s education and subsequent attainable employment as new data from the World Bank and International Labor Organization with gender-sensitive standards have recently become available.  


## Questions
This project will highlight the complex nature of female labor force participation in developing countries and presents findings on the key trends and factors that drive women’s engagement in the labor market and access to employment, especially the role of educational attainment.
 
> Which countries, relative to their demographic age or growth, are leading in female education as indicated by learning outcomes (testing scores in STEM vs other fields) or educational level?  

> Is there a gap between female and male testing performance and is this gap related to childbearing age?  

> Does penetration of technological equipment in the household relate to the level of education completed by females and their workforce participation?


Data science has been widely utilized in finance and healthcare to great effect.  However, use in the educational field is nascent and I believe there is great opportunity for data science to influence policies and initiatives globally.
