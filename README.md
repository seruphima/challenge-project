# The future of women in the global workforce

Global labor force participation rate has steadily declined since 1990 due to aging of population especially in Europe and Asia.  A few countries, most notably Japan, seek to reverse this trend by increasing womenâ€™s labor force participation rate.


## Questions
This project seeks to evaluate several factors to increasing the number of women in the workforce including the education of girls (especially in STEM areas), childcare needs and gender pay gap.  
> Which countries, relative to their demographic age or growth, are leading in female education as indicated by learning outcomes (testing scores in STEM vs other fields) or educational level?  

> Is there a gap between female and male testing performance and is this gap related to childbearing age?  

> Does penetration of technological equipment in the household relate to the level of education completed by females and their workforce participation?


Data science has been widely utilized in finance and healthcare to great effect.  However, use in the educational field is nascent and I believe there is great opportunity for data science to influence policies and initiatives globally.
